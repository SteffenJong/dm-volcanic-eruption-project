# dm-volcanic-eruption-project

This project is based on the data set kindly provided by Italy's Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV).

The project is based on a Kaggle competition, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe.
The goal of the kaggle competition is to train a regression algorithm which can predict the time to eruption based on seismic activity.

Our approach and most of the reasoning behind it can be found in the main.ipynb notebook.

The report (DM_report_Volcaninc_Eruptions...) can be consulted for additional information about the project.

This project was a team effort(2 people), but it still gives an accurate representation of my knowledge regarding the used techniques.
