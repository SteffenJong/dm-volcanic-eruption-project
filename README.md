# dm-volcanic-eruption-project

This project is based on the data set kindly provided by Italy's Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV).

The project is based on a Kaggle competition, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe

Our approach and most of the reasoning behind it can be found in the main.ipynb notebook.

The report (DM_report_Volcaninc_Eruptions...) can be consulted for additional information about the project.

Note this project was a team effort(2 people), but it stil gives an acurate representation of my knowldeg regarding the used techniques.
